This project contains a a bsic HTML website that will be built from scratch.
The website will consolidate my favorite recipes from across the web, allowing
easy access to a wide range of delicious recipes.

From this project, I have practiced the process of creating a new repository
in Github and utilized various Git commands to stage, commit, and push new
changes from my local destination to a remote destination. 

I have also reinforced my understanding of HTML and the basic workflow of
creating a website from scratch. HTML skills learned from this project include
creating an HTML boilerplate, structuring a website, and adding links and
images from across the web.
